I used this tool for my CS2040C Visualgo Quizzes as well as Finals (Online - Open Book)

1. This tool will produce the answers for visualgo quizzes but it is **recommended** that you understand how to derive the answers before using it. If not you're not learning anything!
2. You may modify the code in this tool as you wish but this is **strictly for educational purposes only**. Do not use for any commercial purposes.
3. Have Fun and good luck :)

**How to Use?**
- You can either clone the repo and open it with Visual Studio OR open the Source.cpp file and copy the code into any C++ IDE
